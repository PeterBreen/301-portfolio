# Portfolio site

A personal project developed during and showcasing skills learned during my time at Code Fellows. This portfolio is an MVC-architecture, mobile-first responsive design single page app using Page for clientside routing and jQuery for DOM manipulation, as well as retrieving both local and remote JSON data via ajax request and caching via localstorage for performance.


## Local testing
To serve locally, run [nodemon](https://github.com/remy/nodemon), e.g. `nodemon server.js`
