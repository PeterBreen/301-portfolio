## User Stories: Minimum Viable Product (MVP)
Let these user stories guide your development:
 1. As a developer, I want my site to use valid and semantic markup, so that employers will love me.
 - As the creator, I want the page to link to my social and GitHub pages, so that visitors can follow me, and I can build my audience.
 - As a developer, I want portfolio items displayed with a repeatable template, so that I can reuse it, and abstract out the details for individual projects.

Follow along with these additional user stories to make sure your portfolio looks good on any sized device.

Adapt these stories as necessary to fit how you want to build your portfolio.

## User Stories: MVP
  1. As a visitor, I want the images to be responsive, so that content stays properly proportioned.
  1. As a visitor, I want the viewport properly sized, so that content fits all the size I have available.
  1. As a visitor, I want the primary nav to be responsive, so that I can get around using any device.

## User Stories: Stretch Goals (adapt to fit your portfolio's design)

## Technical Requirements and Grading Rubric
