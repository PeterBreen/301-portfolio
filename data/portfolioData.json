This app uses the Pronto API to power a Google Map showing realtime bike availability per station and allowing a user to get directions to the nearest bike station. A backend Heroku app grabs the JSON every 5 minutes and feeds it into a Firebase db for our stats page, showing historical availability statistics for each station in the system.</p>"

To maximize return on the future Bus Mall catalog, this site allows for user testing - users choose the best of 3 randomly selected products a certain number of times and at the end get to see a Chart.js bar chart showing total lifetime selections for all products - basically a visual representation of which products are most popular from all testers (via localStorage).</p>"

If we wonder if we have tried a particular cider before we can quickly search for it on this site and return relevant results. Responsive design first as the primary use is envisioned to be on a phone.</p>"
